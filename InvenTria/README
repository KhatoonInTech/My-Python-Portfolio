>>> Project Name: Inventory Management System (IMS)
-----------------
>>> Project Introduction:
--------------------------
This project implements a basic inventory management system for food items. 
It allows users to add, edit, delete, search, and display information about food items in a CSV file.

>>> Tech Stack:
----------------
>> Programming Language: Python

>> Libraries:

> csv: Used for reading from and writing to CSV files.
> datetime: Used for working with dates.
> os: Used for interacting with the operating system (error handling).
> tabulate: Used for creating formatted tables from data.

>> Concepts:

> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Uses classes to represent food items and inventory management functionalities.
> File I/O: Reads from and writes data to CSV files.
> Error Handling: Handles potential errors that may occur during file operations or user input.

>>> Key Features:
------------------
> Add food items to the inventory with details like name, category, quantity, price, barcode, and expiry date.
> Edit existing food items in the inventory.
> Delete food items from the inventory.
> Display the entire inventory in a tabular format.
> Search for food items based on various criteria like name, category, quantity, price, barcode, and expiry date.

>>>How Does it Work?
--------------------
1- The system uses a CSV file to store inventory data.

2- Users interact with the system through a command-line interface.

3- The app.py script provides the main entry point for the application.
> It greets the user and gets their name.
> It presents a menu of options for adding, editing, deleting, searching, or displaying inventory items.
> It delegates tasks to the appropriate classes in the IMS_package directory.

4- The IMS_package directory contains the core functionalities of the system.
>> The inventory.py script manages the overall inventory.
   > It interacts with the CSV file using the filing.py class.
   > It provides methods for adding, editing, deleting, searching, and displaying inventory items.
>> The filing.py script handles CSV file operations.
   > It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and writing to the CSV file.
>> The food_items.py script defines a class FoodItems to represent individual food items in the inventory.
   > It stores attributes like name, category, quantity, price, barcode, and expiry date.

>>> Running the System
-----------------------
> Go to InvenTria/dist/Inventria-1.0-win64-msi 
> Download the installer and use it on your machine
